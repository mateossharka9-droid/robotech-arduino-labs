## Arduino Program Structure

Every Arduino program follows the same structure.

---

### setup()

- Runs once when the board starts
- Used to configure pins
- Used to initialize communication

---

### loop()

- Runs continuously
- Executes the main logic
- Allows real-time interaction with hardware

This structure is essential for robotics systems.
