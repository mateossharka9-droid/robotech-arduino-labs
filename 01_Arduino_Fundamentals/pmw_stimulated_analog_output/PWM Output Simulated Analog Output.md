## PWM Output (Simulated Analog Output)

Arduino does not have true analog output.
Instead, it uses Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).

## What is PWM?

PWM rapidly switches a digital pin ON and OFF.
By changing the ON time, we simulate different voltage levels.

## Applications in Robotics

- Motor speed control
- LED brightness
- Power regulation
